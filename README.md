## Guide

- Take your time and don't worry if you cannot finish the page, quality over quantity is preferred here.

- The homepage is in `pages/Home.vue`.

- Break down each section into reusable components and place them inside the `/components` directory.

- Storefront UI components should be used and should be enough to cover all elements shown here. If there is a missing component — feel free to create one in the `components` directory.

- Try to customise CSS by overriding CSS variables in Storefront UI components — follow this guide: https://docs.storefrontui.io/?path=/story/getting-started-development-guide-css-customization--page

- Ask questions.
